Design and develop the owner of the UOH Sugarland cafeteria's biographical page.
As you tackle the task of creating the owner's biography page and the cafeteria's main page, I'm
excited to see your creativity shine. Your challenge is to come up with original designs that capture
the essence of the restaurant. Remember, no copying from others – make it your own!
For the owner's bio, don't forget to add a picture of your headshot. And make sure the bio page

Keep it real and make it great!
