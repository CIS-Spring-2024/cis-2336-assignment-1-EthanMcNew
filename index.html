        <p>Ethan McNew is an aspiring leader in the culinary industry.</p>

        <p>He has benefited Sugar Land by opening various restaurants 
            throughout the city, spreading joy to everyone he feeds.</p>

        <p>Born in Sugar Land, Ethan grew up surrounded by delicious food. At the age of 6, he began helping his family cook all 
            kinds of meals, including eggs, soups, and cakes. While in elementary school, he stayed after school to give a helping 
            hand to the lunch ladies, helping to serve other children nutritious and tasty food.</p>

        <p>In middle school, Ethan signed up for the 10th Annual Chef's Meetup Competition, placing first in the competition 
            with his now famous "McNew Ramen Special." The judges that sampled his soup have declared it "revolutionary 
            due to the healthy ingredients" and "without a doubt better than that instant ramen stuff everyone consumes."</p>

        <P>In high school, Ethan decided what he wanted to do with his career; he wanted to help people in a unique way. 
            By providing food to those who mostly need it, he felt that he would be helping out the cause to end world hunger. 
            After graduating within the business degree path, he began his restaurant business at the age of 19, assisting the University of Houston 
            with his Asian-inspired cuisine.</P>

        <p>In his spare time, he likes to watch all kinds of movies, play video games, and draw.</p>
